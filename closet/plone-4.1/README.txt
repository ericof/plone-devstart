Development buildout
=====================

This buildout has been generated using ``plone-devstart``. It consists of the
following top-level files:

* ``buildout.cfg``, which will build a single Zope instance with a number of
  development tools.
* ``deployment.cfg``, which will build four Zope instances and a ZEO database
  server for them all to connect to.
* ``packages.cfg``, which they both extend, and which lists out packages making
  up the build, including Plone.
* ``versions.cfg``, which is extended by ``packages.cfg``, and which pins down
  package versions for a few of the tools not included in the standard Plone
  Known Good Setup.
